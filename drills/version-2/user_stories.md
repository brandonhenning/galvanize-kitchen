## Prioritization
- servers need to be able to take orders and input
- need to see all exisiting orders
- kitchen staff needs to be able to indicate when order is fulfilled
- end of meal process and give customer bill
- handle payment and process


My justification for prioritizing is as follows : 
    - servers need to be able to enter orders first since nothing else will work without orders entered
    - staff needs to be able to see orders to prepare or do anything else with them
    - kitchen staff needs to be able to indicate completion for them to stay organized and provide usefullness for orders being entered in the first place
    - bill creation at end of meal seems useful but not as much as order management between the kitchen staff and front of house staff so it is getting a lower prioritization 
    - payment process is icing on the cake for an efficient order management system and is not mission critical so gets lowest priority
