Story 4 )

            - a server can select an amount of their tips to give to another user 
            - a servert can select an amount of their tips to send to the kitchen which will be split by all kitchen staff that are clocked in at the time of the order completion


## Prioritization
- servers can see tips they're getting
- servers can analyze data patterns by days of week or shifts
- customer can tip server through app
- servers can tip out other staff


My justification for prioritizing is as follows : 
    - customer said that data analysis was the most important feature of the app they needed so server seeing tips is first
    - server being able to track their tips by shift makes sense for them to be able to make data driven decisions about their shifts and times of day to be working
    - customer being able to tip in app is a great feature and will enable the last feature
    - servers being able to split tips with staff and other servers is the final feature that has lowest priority but is a nice feature that will ease tip sharing but needs tip receiving in app first
