## Stories

Story 1 ) 
    As a user I should have the ability to see my entire stock of items in real time any time I want to. This will help me keep track of my inventory levels without having to manually check.
        - Acceptance criteria
            - all the items in inventory should display with item id, name, and quantity

Story 2) 
    As a user I should be alerted when stock levels are below a certain threshold so that I can be aware of what I need to order. This will help me avoid running out of critical items I need to run the business. 
        - Acceptance criteria
            - there should be an alert set on the quantity field that sends an alert when it is below a certain threshold
            - each alert threshold should be customizable for different items or as user needs change

Story 3) 
    As a user I should have the ability to manually update inventory levels when something comes up and I want to change an item quantity myself. This will give me flexibility for situations where we accidentally order too many things or add a new item or some other unforseen situation. 
        - Acceptance criteria
            - each item should have the ability to change quantity manually

Story 4) 
    As a user I should not have to reorder low items myself but have the application reorder low stock on its own when they are below a certain threshold. This will free up time for me to focus on the rest of the critical things in the business and allow me peace of mind that we won't run out of any items we need.
        - Acceptance criteria
            - there is an order program that is triggered when low inventory level alert is triggered


## Prioritization
- real time inventory 
- manually able to update inventory
- alerted when items are below a certain threshold 
- automatically reording

My justification for prioritizing is as follows : 
    - real time inventory is first since that is the foundation of the other stories
    - manually adjusting inventory is next because that will allow the user to edit mistakes themselves manually without needing a bunch of coding work
    - being alerted to low inventory is next because that is a vital feature that is the next step after being able to see levels and manually adjust them
    - auto reordering is the final story and the most flashy and AI like, it also relies on the first and third story for its functionallity so it makes sense to come last in this list
